# CloudIOClient
The Client-side of the CloudIO software. For server side see: https://github.com/MichaelFack/CloudIOServer

The purpose is to create a client side for a program like Dropbox, Onedrive, Google Drive but with a focus on security: the server knows nothing about the files it is hosting. 


This project is created as part of our (Sofus P. Würtz and Michael Fack Sørensen) 
bachelor project at Aarhus University Denmark, Department of Computer Science.
Supervisor: Claudio Orlandi http://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/
The smart reader now realises the origin of our projects name :)
